it is used to export a given file so that other files are allowed to use it.we can export function,data etc with this.
it promotes modular programming which means creating smaller chunk of modules which can be used and are independent of each other.
it makes it easy to maintain the code base.

5. Difference between default export and named export?
form a given file,only one default export is possible.when we export a value by default,we dont have to import it by using the same name.
from a given file,there can be multiple named exports.when we export by name,we have to import it by using the same name.named exports should be within curly braces.
                export const Function = () => {
                 console.log(""hellow world)
